        <blockquote><img src="https://www.thehawkeyehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-stars.png" width="150"><br/>Great house for a family vacation. Perfectly placed in a great and quiet neighborhood. Pool is beautiful and backyard big enough for our 2 dogs to enjoy. Close to coffee shops, restaurants and shopping areas.
          Both Brian and Mike are great Hosts and we had no problem with communications.
          Hope to come back again!</blockquote>

Wish we could have enjoyed the lovely back yard more, but it was chilly! Had everything we needed or it was an email away.</blockquote>

           Mike responded quickly and was a very hospitable host. The backyard was paradise. Amazing sunsets and Mountain Viewâ€™s while we hung around the sparkling pool.
          Being a chef the kitchen was setup and ready to go with everything I needed to cook for the family.</blockquote>

        <blockquote><img src="https://www.thehawkeyehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-stars.png" width="150"><br/>This house was a great location to stay with some friends and family for my birthday weekend. The house is beautiful and we had such a fun time. Hosts were quick to respond to questions. Also love that it is dog friendly! I am obsessed with the giant palm tree in the back, and we saw the most beautiful birds while we sat and had coffee.</blockquote>
