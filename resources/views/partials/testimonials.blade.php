        <blockquote>Great house for a family vacation. Perfectly placed in a great and quiet neighborhood. Pool is beautiful and backyard big enough for our 2 dogs to enjoy. Close to coffee shops, restaurants and shopping areas.
          Both Brian and Mike are great Hosts and we had no problem with communications.
          Hope to come back again!</blockquote>

        <blockquote>This rental was outstanding!! Our entire family was making the move to AZ.
           Mike responded quickly and was a very hospitable host. The backyard was paradise. Amazing sunsets and Mountain Viewâ€™s while we hung around the sparkling pool.
          Being a chef the kitchen was setup and ready to go with everything I needed to cook for the family.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>We really enjoyed our (unexpected) stay here! My wife, doggy, and I are full-time RVers and we had an unexpected
          breakdown that resulted in some significant repairs. Thank goodness this place was available,
          we ended up staying for a week and loved every minute of it. The host went above and beyond
          to make us feel at home and we loved recharging and relaxing by the pool, taking long walks down
          by the canal, and bbq'ing in the really spacious back yard. Thank you again Mike for being so accommodating,
          we'd definitely stay here again....even if our RV isn't in the shop :)</blockquote>
